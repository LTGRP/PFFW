You can change the date of statistics using drop-down boxes. An empty value means match-all. For example, if you choose 3 for month and empty value for day fields, the charts and lists display statistics for all the days in March. Choosing empty value for month means empty value for day field as well.

For single dates, Horizontal chart direction is assumed. For date ranges, default graph style is Daily, and direction is Vertical. Graph style can be changed to Hourly for date ranges, where cumulative hourly statistics are shown. In Daily style, horizontal direction is not possible.');
